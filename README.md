# Udacity Front End Web Development - Neighborhood Map Project
---

## Project Overview:

For the **Neighborhood Map** project, I am creating a map of the outdoor art around Nashville, TN.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### Specification

This site has been built using React,Google Maps, and a 3rd party API from https://data.nashville.gov/.  It will include a list of art that can be searched by title and category.  

### How to Run

1. Download the files and unzip them to your desktop.

2.  In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:3000`.
